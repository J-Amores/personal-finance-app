- [ ] Add data visualization components

## Component Structure
```

├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout with providers
│   └── page.tsx        # Home page with overview

│   ├── transactions/  # Transaction components

```

## Design Decisions
1. Using TanStack Query for:
   - Data fetching and caching
   - Server state management
   - Real-time updates
   
2. Styling Approach:
   - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
   - Shadcn UI for consistent component design
   - Custom theme configuration for dark/light modes

3. Layout Structure:
   - Persistent sidebar navigation
   - Main content area with responsive grid
   - Card-based UI for different data sections

## Known Issues & Considerations
- Need to implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states for data fetching
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for data
- Add proper form validation
- Consider accessibility improvements
