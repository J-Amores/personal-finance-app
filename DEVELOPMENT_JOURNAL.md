## Component Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx      # Root layout with providers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx        # Home page with overview
â”œâ”€â”€ components/         # (To be implemented)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/            # Shadcn UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ budgets/       # Budget related components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ transactions/  # Transaction components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pots/          # Savings pots components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bills/         # Bills components
â””â”€â”€ hooks/             # Custom hooks for data fetching
```

## Design Decisions
1. Using TanStack Query for:
   - Data fetching and caching
   - Server state management
   - Real-time updates
   
2. Styling Approach:
   - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
   - Shadcn UI for consistent component design
   - Custom theme configuration for dark/light modes

3. Layout Structure:
   - Persistent sidebar navigation
   - Main content area with responsive grid
   - Card-based UI for different data sections

## Known Issues & Considerations
- Need to implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states for data fetching
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for data
- Add proper form validation
- Consider accessibility improvements
